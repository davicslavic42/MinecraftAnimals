Minecraft Animals is a mod that adds in different mobs and such from minecraft as you'd expect, and a small amount of other things
to create a little minecraft ambience in your world. Note, this is still wip and not every single mc thing is going to be put in.
Thanks to: Gameraiders101 for showing the mod,  rebmiami the previous lead dev and creator, Chem (collaberator), GabeHasWon (massive code help),
